            <h5>What’s the Deal?</h5>
            <p>
               Aotearoa is beautiful. Our forests and green spaces are humming with unique and beautiful life. They allow us to breathe, eat, explore,
               play and connect. They have given us so much. It is our turn to give back.
            </p>
            <p>
               The consequences of long-overlooked climate destruction are starting to show. Our cities may be expanding but at what cost? Protecting
               and preserving New Zealand's flora and fauna has never been more crucial than now. We have the ability and responsibility to shape our
               future and to create a better world for current and future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
               To show our love, this is a space to share our memories, hopes and loves—appreciating all that nature brings, from the deepest bush to
               our local gardens, to remember why we should take action to protect the place we call home.

            <p>
               Sometimes we feel like we can’t enact change, but every action plants a seed for a better future. We’ve listed some simple things you
               can do to give back. Why not give one a go?

                  <p>
                     Get stuck into hands-on volunteering opportunities such as tree planting days and clean-ups. These activities foster community
                     and are a great activity to do with friends.

                     protecting and preserving our natural landscapes.

                  <p>
                     Consider how you can reduce your impact on nature in your daily life. Walk or take the bus, use a reusable cup for your morning
                     coffee and opt for more sustainable products.

                  <p>
                     Time to get outside and create a garden at home. Include native plants and flowers to bring endemic species and pollinators to
                     your little forest. It may be hard work, but it will be rewarding and you will have a little oasis for yourself to enjoy.
